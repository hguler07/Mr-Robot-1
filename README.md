Trix

A Rich Text Editor for Everyday Writing

Compose beautifully formatted text in your web application. Trix is a WYSIWYG editor for writing messages, comments, articles, and listsâ€”the simple documents most web apps are made of. It features a sophisticated document model, support for embedded attachments, and outputs terse and consistent HTML.

Trix is an open-source project from Basecamp, the creators of Ruby on Rails. Millions of people trust their text to Basecamp, and we built Trix to give them the best possible editing experience. See Trix in action in the all-new Basecamp 3.
